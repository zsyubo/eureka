 * 如果一个租约没有续期，它最终会过期，从而标记相关的T立即被驱逐 - 这类似于明确的取消，只是T和LeaseManager之间没有通信。

 * shutdowns that is not uncommon in AWS environments.
 *
 * If a lease elapses without renewals, it will eventually expire consequently
 * marking the associated {@link T} for immediate eviction - this is similar to
 * an explicit cancellation except that there is no communication between the
 * {@link T} and {@link LeaseManager}.
